# Hello,

If you're finding this message now, it's with a heavy heart that I must say you've arrived too late. **Bigfoot Game's Shack** was an incredible journey that positively changed countless lives, including mine, as part of the original development team of BGS.

As all good things must, this amazing experience now comes to an end. We deeply appreciate the wonderful memories we've shared together.

For any future contact, please reach out via Discord: **08flare**.

Bigfoot will forever hold a special place in my heart, and if it's touched you in any way, I hope you feel the same.

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors,

**7lat / Tadashi**  
_Last & Final Member of the BGS Team_
